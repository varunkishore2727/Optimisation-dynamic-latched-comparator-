OPTIMIZATION OF DOUBLE TAIL DYNAMIC LATCHED COMPARATOR USING MOPSO ALGORITHM


The increasing demand for energy-efficient, high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in
modern electronic systems continues to drive the need for optimized dynamic latch comparators.
This project focuses on increasing the performance of a double-tail dynamic latch comparator
which is an essential building block in ADCs and other mixed-signal circuits. Here we are using
180nm CMOS technology. Our primary objective is to simultaneously minimize three key
performance metrics: power consumption, time delay, and offset voltage. These objectives are
addressed by optimizing transistor sizing, specifically the widths of critical MOSFETs.
To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we employ a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm
combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE). PSO is used
for its quick convergence in continuous design spaces, while DE introduces randomness to improve
exploration and escape local optima. In the proposed approach, DE is selectively applied to a
portion of the population, enhancing diversity without compromising convergence speed. The
algorithm is guided by analytical equations that model the comparatorâ€™s delay, power dissipation,
and offset voltage.
The resulting Pareto optimal design solutions demonstrate effective trade-offs among power, speed,
and accuracy. This hybrid optimization strategy offers a robust and computationally efficient
pathway to analog circuit design, especially suited for low-power and high-performance ADC
applications
